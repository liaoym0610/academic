Welcome to my personal website!
-----

My name is Yumeng Liao and I'm currently a Postdoc Researcher of <a href="https://roque.princeton.edu" target="_blank">Prof. Jose Roque</a>'s group at Princeton University. I'm interested in organic synthesis and organometallic chemistry. <br><br>

I obtained my PhD from the University of Tokyo under the supervision of <a href="http://park.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/nozakilab/indexE.html" target="_blank">Prof. Kyoko Nozaki</a> in 2025. My research focused on the development of homegeneous nickel catalyst for the selective degradation of thermosetting resins. <br><br>

Before joining the Nozaki group, I conducted my undergraduate research with <a href="https://www.rs.tus.ac.jp/mtd/" target="_blank">Prof. Takanori Matsuda</a> at Toyko University of Science, and my master research with <a href="http://www.chemistry.titech.ac.jp/~iwasawa/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. Nobuharu Iwasawa</a> at Tokyo Institute of Technology, where I was working on rhodium and ruthenium catalysis for Câ€“H activation.<br><br>
